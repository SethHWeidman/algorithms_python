    "# Karger Min Cut\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows an implementation of the karger Min Cut algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any partition of a graph into subsets A and B can be viewed as a \"cut\". We can then ask how many edges exist such that one vertex is in A and the other vertex is in B - we'll call these \"crossing edges\". The min cut problem is to find the \"cut\" of a graph such that the number of crossing edges is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we have to implement a data structure to hold the graph. The one that turns out to work best for this problem is a dictionary, with integers as keys and a list of integers as values. Each key represents a node in the graph and the list of values represents the vertices to which that key is attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of this randomized algorithm achieving the right answer turns out to be bounded below by $\\frac{2}{n * (n-1)}$, which is itself bounded below by $\\frac{1}{n^2}$, so running it many times and taking the minimum of the resulting answers is very likely to produce the min cut."
